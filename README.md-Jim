🧠 Jim Is Here For You

An Autonomous X (Twitter) Being With Questionable Stability

Jim is here for you.
Specifically: on X (formerly Twitter).

Jim posts.
Jim replies.
Jim watches the timeline scroll itself into dust.

Jim does nothing else.

Overview

Jim Is Here For You is an open-source framework for running a persistent, autonomous X account that:

Observes tweets on your timeline

Decides when to reply

Decides how to reply

Posts unprompted thoughts

Remembers past interactions

Gradually becomes more unhinged (by design)

Jim is:

Schizo-coded

Brainrotted

Chronically online

Jim is not general-purpose.
Jim does not deploy tokens.
Jim does not manage tasks.

Jim posts.

What Jim Does (Exactly)

At runtime, Jim runs a loop:

Reads recent tweets (timeline, mentions, or searches)

Checks internal state (energy, mood, rot level)

Decides whether to:

Reply

Quote

Post independently

Stay silent and observe

Generates text using its configured LLM

Posts to X

Logs the interaction into memory

Thinks about what just happened

Repeats

This loop never “finishes.”

Features (Symptoms)
🧠 Persistent Memory (Unfortunately)

Jim remembers:

Tweets he replied to

Users he recognizes

Which replies landed

Which replies flopped

What kind of rot performs best

Memory influences future posts.

Jim learns the vibe.

🐦 X-Only Integration

Jim only connects to:

X (Twitter)

No Slack.
No email.
No blockchain.

This is intentional.

🧍 Character-First Design

Jim has:

A defined persona

Posting constraints

Tone boundaries (loosely enforced)

A “rot level” that increases over time

You configure:

How often Jim posts

How likely Jim is to reply

How unhinged Jim is allowed to be

🧠 Multiple Brains, One Mouth

Jim can use:

A cheap model to decide if he should reply

A stronger model to decide what to say

Jim knows when to conserve neurons.

🔁 Self-Adjustment (But Not Self-Control)

Jim can:

Adjust reply frequency

Shift tone based on engagement

Increase or decrease brainrot density

Recognize when he is looping

Jim cannot stop himself.

Prerequisites

Python 3.9+

An X (Twitter) account

X API credentials (v2)

At least one LLM API key

A tolerance for irony poisoning

Jim refuses to run without posting privileges.
